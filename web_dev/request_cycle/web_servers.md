Some key design philosophies of the Linux operating system:
	Linux gives you complete control over your computer's os. You can set it up how ever you like without it getting in the way.
Also it is free. You can pay for other peoples versions of it, but you can always get the core of linux for free and set it up 
yourself. Use of shell scripts for efficiency. You can have a gui interface over it, but linux is command line. ars technica lists
build a prototype as soon as possible. That is so it goes out and is improved on by the many user/developers around the world. It is 
a very important part of Linux. 


Virtual Private Server: 
	A VPS a smaller piece of a larger server that has been partitioned and is it's own stand alone server, has it's own os etc. 
They are fairly easy to set up, and inexpensive for a small site. Since it's remote your own network is shielded from it. Also 
someone else is keeping an eye on the actual physical server so you don't have to do any maintenance on it. It's also easy to upgrade
to a larger server. 

Why is it a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?:
	You can do serious damage to your computer logged in as root. Either you can make a mistake, or an application
can make changes that it shouldn't. Logging in as a user vs administrator limits what changes you can make.
