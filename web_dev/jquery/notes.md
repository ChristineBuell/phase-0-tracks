jQuery study plan

First I'll do a google search to see what comes up. It will give me an idea different directions I can take.

I'll specifically see what mozilla and wc3 websites have for me.

I will also search for books. if I see one that I think will be extremely helpful, I'll buy it and download it to my iPad.

I learn better by doing, so as soon as I figure out how I'll try a simple jQuery statement. When I find something more complicated 
I'll test that too.


jQuery is a library. The easiest way to access it is for a script tag directing that it be downloaded from a third party site like 
google or microsoft to be placed the header of index.html. One reason its popular is it's completely cross browser compatible. jQuery uses a $ to 
signify its jQuery.
