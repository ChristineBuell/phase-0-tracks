jQuery study plan

First I'll do a google search to see what comes up. It will give me an idea different directions I can take.

I'll specifically see what mozilla and wc3 websites have for me.

I will also search for books. if I see one that I think will be extremely helpful, I'll buy it and download it to my iPad.

I learn better by doing, so as soon as I figure out how I'll try a simple jQuery statement. When I find something more complicated 
I'll test that too.


After two hours:

The google searches got a lot of good information (and a lot of unhelpful as well.) I spent the most time at w3school going through
some of theie small exercises. read the beginning of one book, and it was good but doing the exercises was a better way to understand. 
Maybe it was because I'd already done the other things, but the last thing I did was go to Digital Ocean and read their intro to jQuery 
and it made the most sense to me. So I think trying it out and then rereading made it more clear.
