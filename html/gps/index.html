I felt this was a very valuable session, because of Alan's persistance we were able to successfully define and use a sublime code snippet!
Purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to clearly define an element or section's purpose in an HTML page. Some useful ones are <table>, <form>, 
or <nav> for navigation. Actually I think they're all useful, since they help with automation like screen readers. The browser calculates 
the layout first and then places the content on the screen. Sublime is a very useful tool that can be tweaked by the user to fit his or her 
needs. I will definitely make my own code snippets. The most difficult concept for me was actually using the sublime code snippets. I had tried
to make one beforehand and messed something up so if I typed the letter 'p' and pressed tab, the letter disappeared and the curser went to the 
next line! I then had to figure out where the file was and navigate in terminal to find it and delete it to undo the damage. They have a template,
but I don't really understand the script they use so I can only make one being walked through a tutorial. I will look up the documentation 
on Sublime because I can see this is very useful
