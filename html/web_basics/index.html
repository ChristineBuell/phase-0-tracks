    <h1>I Love Siamese Cats!</h1>
    <p>
    Siamese cats are a lot of fun! Some people say they are a little like dogs, and I did have one that would play fetch. They are very demanding though and so not everyone is as fond of them as I am. Here is a short list of reasons why to love Siamese cats, as well as a few drawbacks.</p>
     <h2>Reasons Siamese cats are great!:</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>They’re smart.</li>
	   <li>The can jump really high!</li>
       <li>They <em>talk </em>to you.</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Some reasons people don’t like Siamese cats:</h2>
     <ol>
       <li>They talk a lot!</li>
       <li>They’re very <strong>loud</strong>!</li>
       <li>They’re very inquisitive, so they get into things.</li>
     </ol>
