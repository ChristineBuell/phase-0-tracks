Driver code enters word for guessing
	Taken in as a string
	Word split out into character array
guess_count equals word length
guess_count keeps array of guesses
	Guessing the same letter twice won't count against the guess_count countdown(so guess count could be guess_array.length)
Outline of word is printed to screen: Underscores for each letter with quotes on each end
Correct guess starts as array of underscores that are replaced as correct letters are added.


User enters a letter
Every guess entered causes feedback:
Check length of string to see if letter or word
	Letter checks to see if letter already guessed.
		IF yes, message, says how many more tries

		IF no, checks against word
		correct reprints screen
			*check for all letters being filled in, user should be able to win if they guess all the letter but never enter the word!
			Check against correct word array for placement(s) of letter
			Every correct guess causes string to reprint to screen with correct letters in placement
		incorrect says to try again you have x many more tries

	If multiple letters (word)
		check against original word entered
		IF matches, user wins in x many guesses (including word)
		IF not, user is taunted and game over
