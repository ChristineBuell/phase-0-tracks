Release 4: Reflections

I realized that I had not been pseudocoding in enough detail, I hadn't made the connection that a line of pseudocode then 
	translating into a line of actual code. 

We used an array for taking in the initial space delimited list, It's (I find) easier to work with arrays for i/o operations, searching etc. 
	But for the grocery list exercise a hash with its key/value structure made more sense. 
	
A method returns the result of the last operation. 

About anything can be passed to a method as an argument: variables, arrays, hashes, other methods.

To pass information from one method to another, you can call one method from another. 

I felt more comfortable with Ruby methods, but I still feel unsure of myself with hashes. I have to keep, looking up the documentation 
	for simple operations. I realize that programmers are always looking things up, but I feel like I need to be better grounded than 
	this. I don't feel the same way about arrays, maybe because I've used them before.

# Method to create a list
# input: string of items separated by spaces (example: "carrots apples cereal pizza")
# steps: 
- DONT EVEN DO Prompt the user to enter a string with instructions, print
- DONT EVEN DO accept user input, save to variable
- split the user input by space, using .split(' ')
# set default quantity
- iterate through the array of items
- Assign each item to a hash entry with key of item value of item name
- give each new hash entry a qty key, value of 1
# print the list to the console [can you use one of your other methods here?]
- REFER TO BOTTOM THING
# output: [what data type goes here, array or hash?]

# Method to remove an item from the list
# input: list, name of the item you wish to remove

- accept parameter to method that is name of item you want to delete
- iterate through aray of hashes for item where item value is paramter
- delete that guy
# output:
- Return new full aray of hashes minus deleted item

- accept parameter to method
- iterate through aray of hashes for item where item value is paramter
- Update that items qty key to new value
# output:
The updated item value and its qty, using the print method

Formatted list like this 'Carrots - QTY 1'
