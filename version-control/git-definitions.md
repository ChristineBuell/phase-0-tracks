# Git Definitions

**Instructions:** Define each of the following **Git** concepts.

* What is version control? Why is it useful? 
   * Version control software keeps a chronological record of all changes made the project in a repository. If there is a computer failure, corrupted files, or human error such as someone adds untested code and breaks the software, the developers can go back to a previous working version.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
   * A branch contains a copy of the master file that you've checked out to work with. You wouldn't want to work with the master file, since it has to be the version that works, the clean version. A branch contains a copy and a reference to the master branch.  

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
   * A commit essentially saves the changes you've made to files you've worked on in your branch. Commit messages should reflect the changes you've made, or what you worked on.

* What is a merge conflict?
   * A merge conflict happens when you have more than one commit making changes to the same thing in a program. An example would be the same line of code is changed two different ways. If there are competing changes then git will not know which one to choose.
